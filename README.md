# Sparse embedding max margin dictionary learning (SEMMDL)

This code contains the detailed implementation of SEMMDL. Please refer to the following paper:

	high dimensinality data classification via dl.

Please run 

	main.m

to see the results on several face recognition benchmark datasets. semmdl.m is the main function 
calling the SEMMDL algorithm to solve DDL problem
